The SQL database with all the Pokemon and its stats is hosted on Turso.
You must log in as skywaterr in order to edit the database on Turso's dashboard.
The problem with this is that Turso's dashboard allows you to edit data one row at a time,
and you cannot import a CSV.

So the other option is to use Turso's CLI to edit, but you will have to do a lot more stuff,
just like how John was tortured into doing it. These are the steps.

1. If you are using Windows, you have to use wsl to curl the executable. John uses wsl Ubuntu,
   and that one is the recommended one because there is less installation steps.

2. Once Turso is installed, you will not have your CSV file directly in the same directory.
   /mnt is where your regular Windows directories. You will have to find the path to your CSV
   and keep it somewhere.

3. You will have to have sqlite3 installed in your vm.

4. Turso will need a key, so ChatGPT to find out how to get that.

5. Use a command like this to push it onto the desired db/table: 
    sqlite3 :memory: ".mode csv" ".import src/to/csv table-name" ".dump" | turso db shell db-name
   


To start the server and retrieve data from the db, run npm start, and use the routes that
are predefined in routes.js
