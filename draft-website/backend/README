The SQL database with all the Pokemon and its stats is hosted on Turso.
You must log in as skywaterr in order to edit the database on Turso's dashboard.
The problem with this is that Turso's dashboard allows you to edit data one row at a time,
and you cannot import a CSV.

So the other option is to use Turso's CLI to edit, but you will have to do a lot more stuff,
just like how John was tortured into doing it. These are the steps.

1. If you are using Windows, you have to use wsl to curl the executable. John uses wsl Ubuntu,
   and that one is the recommended one because there is less installation steps.

2. Once Turso is installed, you will not have your CSV file directly in the same directory.
   /mnt is where your regular Windows directories. You will have to find the path to your CSV
   and keep it somewhere.

3. You will have to have sqlite3 installed in your vm.

4. Turso will need a key, so ChatGPT to find out how to get that.

5. Use a command like this to push it onto the desired db/table: 
    sqlite3 :memory: ".mode csv" ".import src/to/csv table-name" ".dump" | turso db shell db-name
   


To start the server and retrieve data from the db, run npm start, and use the routes that
are predefined in routes/home.js.

These are the possible STATS and OPERATORS that can be used for queries:

STATS: hp, atk, def, s.at, s.df, spd, bst
OPS: gte (>=), gt (>), eq (=), lt (<), lte (<=)

Any time the {STAT} or {OP} is used, that means any of the above symbols can be swapped in.

The following routes are defined, along with an example of each:

http://localhost:3000/pokemon?{STAT}[{OP}]=NUMBER               // Query pokemon by a specific stat with some comparison operator
http://localhost:3000/pokemon?HP[gte]=100                       // Look for pokemon with HP >= 100

http://localhost:3000/pokemon?ability=name                      // Query pokemon by what ability they can learn
http://localhost:3000/pokemon?ability=Overgrow                  // Find all pokemon that can learn Overgrow

http://localhost:3000/pokemon?move=name                         // Query pokemon by what move they can learn
http://localhost:3000/pokemon?move=Vine Whip                    // Find all pokemon that can learn Vine Whip
http://localhost:3000/pokemon?move=Vine Whip&move=Tackle        // Find all pokemon that can learn both Vine Whip and Tackle


The filters below apply to one specific move if they are composed.
For example, if the power[gt]=120 and movetype=Fire filters are applied,
the query will search for pokemon with a move that contains both these
aspects.


http://localhost:3000/pokemon?power[start]=125&power[end]=130   // Query pokemon that can learn a move with power between [125, 130]
http://localhost:3000/pokemon?power[start]=125                  // Query pokemon that can learn a move with at least 125 power
http://localhost:3000/pokemon?power[end]=130                    // Query pokemon that can learn a move with at most 130 power

http://localhost:3000/pokemon?class=Physical                    // Query pokemon that can learn a physical move
http://localhost:3000/pokemon?class=Special                     // Query pokemon that can learn a special move

http://localhost:3000/pokemon?movetype={type}                   // Query pokemon that can learn moves of a certain type. Refer to type chart
http://localhost:3000/pokemon?movetype=Fire                     // Query pokemon that can learn a fire type move.

http://localhost:3000/pokemon?accuracy[{OP}]=NUMBER             // Query pokemon that can learn moves with a certain accuracy.
http://localhost:3000/pokemon?accuracy[gt]=80                   // Query pokemon that can learn a move with accuracy higher than 80.



All of the move filters can be used at the same time, as shown below:

// Look for pokemon that can learn a move with power >= 125, is a Special Attack, has accuracy higher than 90, and is a Grass type
http://localhost:3000/pokemon?power[start]=125&class=Special&accuracy[gt]=90&movetype=Grass         // This should find only Electrode-Hisui


The move filters cannot be a mix of move=NAME and move-specific filters:

// This will return nothing, because Vine Whip and Tackle are not Fighting type moves
http://localhost:3000/pokemon?move=Vine Whip&move=Tackle&movetype=Fighting
